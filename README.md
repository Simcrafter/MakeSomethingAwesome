The calculation of the range, trajectories, and velocities of trebuchets has to do with the scientific principles of forces and projectile motion. 

Programs which calculate projectiles trajectories have many purposes in the real world. They can be used by organizations such as militaries to calculate the angle that they need to aim their pieces of artillery to hit a target. Now of course today most militaries donâ€™t use trebuchets but the program could be very easily adapted to work for a artillery cannon.

This program could even theoretically be used to calculate the trajectory of a thrown object. Or used in a computer game involving medieval warfare. It could be used to calculate the trajectory for a projectile and then render it. In fact programs similar to this are used in many games presently to calculate factors such as bullet drop.
